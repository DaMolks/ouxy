*Expand your application into a constellation of possibilities*

## 🌟 Core System (The Sun)

At the heart of Ouxy lies a powerful core system that acts as the gravitational center of your application universe. It manages:

- 🛸 Dynamic module loading
- 🌍 Shared resources and data
- 🌠 Inter-module communication
- 🌓 Lifecycle management

## 🪐 Modules (The Planets)

Each module in Ouxy is an independent world that:

- 🌎 Has its own ecosystem
- 🌏 Maintains its own data
- 🌍 Follows its own lifecycle
- 🌋 Can evolve independently

## ☄️ Features

### Solar System Architecture
- **Core (The Sun)**: Central system providing energy and resources
- **Modules (Planets)**: Independent functionalities orbiting the core
- **Communications (Gravitational Fields)**: Seamless interaction between components
- **Resources (Stardust)**: Shared assets and utilities

### Cosmic Development
- 🚀 Hot-swappable modules
- 💫 Real-time development mode
- 🌌 Runtime module management
- 🛸 Wireless debugging

### Universal Tools
- Development Console: Navigate your application universe
- Module Workshop: Create new celestial bodies
- Observatory: Monitor your system

## Quick Start

1. Initialize the Core
```kotlin
class App : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        Ouxy.initialize(this)
    }
}
```

2. Create a Module
```kotlin
@OuxyModule
class MyModule : BaseModule() {
    override fun initialize() {
        // Your module initialization
    }
}
```

3. Launch into Orbit
```kotlin
Ouxy.loadModule(MyModule::class.java)
```

## 🌍 Development Mode

Enter the development constellation:

1. Enable developer mode in your application
2. Connect via Android Studio plugin
3. Navigate through your module universe
4. Deploy changes at light speed
